## Project description

Cyber-physical systems are systems in which software elements are in control of physical entities. Most systems in the industry fall under this definition. Thus, the ability to identify such systems to simple models is critical. The hybrid automaton formalism allows for a systematic approach to the modelisation of such system. This library is a compilation of hybrid automata models that can be used to evaluate identification methods.
